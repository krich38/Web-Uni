Project description:
	"A registration page, where users can register using an email address and password
    A log-in page (and log-out link, and a way of remotely logging out the user’s other sessions)
    A page from which users can post messages. This page should also show the user’s most recently posted messages.
    A page where users can enter a search for a user or topic, and it will produce a results page containing that user or topic’s most recent messages
    A landing page for your service. This will contain a link to a page for posting messages
    Each message should have a unique ID. You might find java.util.UUID.randomUUID() useful for allocating these.
    POST requests to the path /api/postmessage should post a message. This API should accept a plain text message.
    GET requests to the path /api/users/{username} should return the user’s most recent messages in JSON format.
    GET requests to the path /api/tags/{tag} should return the #tag’s most recent messages in JSON format."
